# Player Toolkit Implementation Work Log

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 0 - Implementation Readiness

Branch: `codex/assistant-companion-roadmap`

Purpose:

- Prepare the repository for phased implementation of the player-toolkit roadmap.
- Establish the per-phase goal loop, review, QA, work-log, and commit protocol before Phase 1 starts.
- Keep Phase 0 behavior-preserving and documentation-only.

Parent roadmap:

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-player-toolkit-assistant-roadmap-design.md`

Artifacts:

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-phase-0-implementation-readiness-design.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-19-phase-0-implementation-readiness.md`
- `docs/superpowers/qa/2026-06-19-phase-0-implementation-readiness-qa.md`
- `docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-06-19-phase-0-consultant-readiness.md`
- `docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-06-19-phase-0-adversarial-readiness.md`
- `docs/qa-scenarios.md`
- `docs/work-log/player-toolkit-implementation.md`

Design decisions:

- Phase 0 is documentation scaffolding only. It must not implement Phase 1 runtime behavior.
- Autonomous QA pathways live under `docs/superpowers/qa/`.
- One program-level work log tracks phase decisions, review outcomes, verification, and blockers.
- Durable review records live under `docs/superpowers/reviews/` so final approvals can be inspected without reading the conversation.
- The detailed Phase 1 source/rules spec is intentionally deferred to the Phase 1 goal loop, where source facts can be refreshed before design approval.
- Browser and Computer Use checks are required only for phases that change web, desktop, packaged, or runtime behavior.

Review gates:

- Consultant review must confirm the Phase 0 artifact set is sufficient to start Phase 1.
- Adversarial review must confirm Phase 0 does not prematurely implement Phase 1, lacks no proof gates, and has an executable QA pathway.

Consultant review triage:

- Accepted: add durable review evidence.
- Accepted: update `docs/qa-scenarios.md` with roadmap phase QA expectations.
- Accepted: add preflight, AGENTS compliance, behavior-preservation, optional baseline, and Browser/Computer Use checks to the Phase 0 QA pathway.
- Accepted with scope clarification: do not create the Phase 1 fine-grain spec in Phase 0; create it inside the Phase 1 goal loop.

Adversarial review triage:

- Accepted: record actual consultant and adversarial outcomes in durable review files instead of placeholders.
- Accepted: add freshness/source-refresh requirements for phases using mutable official, public-sheet, MFM, roster, mission-pack, or community-pack data.
- Accepted: replace brittle workspace-path preconditions with a `Resolve-Path .` check.
- Accepted: include untracked files in behavior-preservation checks and use an explicit Phase 0 allowlist.
- Accepted: scope AGENTS compliance checks to changed, staged, and untracked files.
- Accepted: require exact staged-file set in any order, forbid staging user-owned `AGENTS.md`, and add post-commit proof.

Final review approvals:

- 2026-06-20: consultant reviewer `019ee4cb-1a71-72f3-80d2-35838a50cfc9` approved Phase 0 readiness.
- 2026-06-20: adversarial reviewer `019ee4cb-4274-7211-9b4e-a757e02b1110` approved Phase 0 scope, source-trust, IP/security, and QA executability.

Verification to run before commit:

- `git status --short --branch`
- Draft-marker scan across Phase 0 artifacts.
- ASCII scan across Phase 0 artifacts.
- `git diff --check`
- `git diff --cached --check`
- Behavior-preservation check with `git diff --name-only` and `git diff --cached --name-only`

Verification results:

- 2026-06-20: required Phase 0 artifacts exist.
- 2026-06-20: draft-marker scan returned no matches.
- 2026-06-20: ASCII scan returned no non-ASCII findings.
- 2026-06-20: `git diff --check` passed; Git reported only the normal line-ending warning for `docs/qa-scenarios.md`.
- 2026-06-20: behavior-preservation allowlist passed. Visible changed/untracked files are the Phase 0 docs plus user-owned untracked `AGENTS.md`.
- 2026-06-20: AGENTS/source-trust compliance check passed for changed, staged, and untracked files.
- 2026-06-20: `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check .` passed; Ruff reported a nonblocking cache-write warning.
- 2026-06-20: `.\.venv\Scripts\mypy.exe src` passed.
- 2026-06-20: `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest` passed: 187 passed, 1 warning.
- 2026-06-20: `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m warhammer_companion.cli validate-packets --packet-dir src\warhammer_companion\seed_data\map-packets` passed for 45 official seed packets.
- 2026-06-20: `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m warhammer_companion.desktop.app --smoke-test` passed with status `ok` and 45 official packets.
- 2026-06-20: Browser and Computer Use checks were not required for Phase 0 because the phase changes no runtime, web, desktop, or packaged behavior.

Baseline note:

- 2026-06-20: optional `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff format --check src tests` reported existing formatting drift in `src\warhammer_companion\los\geometry.py`. Phase 0 did not modify that source file. This should be handled in a later `.5` housekeeping loop rather than inside the docs-only Phase 0 checkpoint unless reviewers decide it blocks readiness.

Known notes:

- `AGENTS.md` is present in the worktree and applies to the repository. It is treated as user-owned unless explicitly staged for this phase.
- No production code, tests, data, packaging, web UI, or desktop UI should change in Phase 0.
